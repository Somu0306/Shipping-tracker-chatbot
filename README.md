# 🚚 Shipping Tracker Chatbot

A lightweight, low-latency **chat-based shipment tracking system** that allows users to track logistics shipments using natural language queries.  
Built with Python and Streamlit, the project demonstrates conversational AI principles and is **GenAI-ready**.

> 🏆 Developed as part of the **Intel® GenAI for Gen-Z Challenge**

---

## 📌 Overview

The **Shipping Tracker Chatbot** provides an intuitive conversational interface for tracking shipment status using shipment IDs.  
Instead of navigating complex logistics dashboards, users can simply ask questions like:

- “track SH1001?”
- “where is my shipment SH1002”

and instantly receive shipment details.

The system is designed to be:
- **Fast**
- **Lightweight**
- **Easy to extend with GenAI models**

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional shipment tracking systems often:
- Have high response latency
- Require multiple UI interactions
- Are not conversational
- Are difficult to integrate with AI assistants

This project solves these issues by introducing a **chatbot-based tracking interface** with optimized data handling and robust input parsing.

---

## 💡 Solution Highlights

- Conversational chatbot interface
- Low-latency shipment lookup using compressed JSON data
- Robust input sanitization (handles punctuation, casing, noisy text)
- Modular backend architecture
- Web-based frontend using Streamlit
- Easily extendable to real APIs and GenAI models

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔍 Track shipments using shipment ID
- 🗣️ Natural language query handling
- ⚡ Fast responses using in-memory data
- 🧹 Input cleaning & validation
- 💬 Chat-style web interface
- 🧩 Clean and modular codebase

---

## 🧠 GenAI Alignment

Although the current implementation uses rule-based NLP techniques, the architecture is **GenAI-ready**:

- Can integrate Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Supports conversational AI workflows
- Optimized for low-latency inference
- Suitable for Intel-optimized AI runtimes

This makes the project a strong foundational GenAI application.
